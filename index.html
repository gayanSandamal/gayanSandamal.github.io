          <p class="lead">I'm a driven and creative Full-Stack Developer with a 9+ year passion for crafting
            user-centric web experiences. Fueled by a natural curiosity for technology and a love for tinkering, my
            journey began with building websites and experimenting with code. This passion led me to pursue a career
            where I could combine my technical expertise with a love for beautiful interfaces.</p>

          <p class="lead">Throughout my career, I've thrived on building both web and mobile applications. Leveraging
            frameworks like Vue.js for web and React Native for mobile, I take pride in designing intuitive UIs and UX
            flows using Figma. My experience spans diverse projects, from open-source tools like Planning Poker Minimal
            (streamlining team estimations with Vue.js) to a comprehensive Learning Management System (Akurata)
            empowering educational institutions. I've also built user-centric platforms like Findyo, which connects
            users with services, using a combination of Laravel, PHP, and Firebase for back-end functionality and
            real-time communication.</p>
          <p class="lead">This journey has fostered a strong foundation in various technologies. But my true passion
            lies in [describe what motivates you in this field, e.g., creating user-friendly interfaces, solving complex
            problems, etc.]. I'm particularly fascinated by the ever-evolving nature of JavaScript frameworks like
            Vue.js and React Native, and their potential to create dynamic and interactive experiences across web and
            mobile platforms.</p>
